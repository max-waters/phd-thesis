** Captions

Do not capitalise every word, not a heading.
Short form in index: no full stop
Long form in text: full stop.

** Careful

Symmetry group (any group of permutations) vs symmetric group (eg S_n)
A problem is in \FPT but an algorithm runs in fpt-time

** Defining new terms:
In text, use \emph{term}.
In a definition environment, use \defterm{term}


For example, plan $P_1$ ("plan" is lower case)


** Abbreviations

In text, use "that is", and "for example". Only use abbreviations in parenthetical statements, (e.g., like this).
Use abbreviation macros for \IFF, \WRT, \ST but not e.g., or i.e.,.
Use "respectively" not "resp."

"Vice versa" and other latin in italics

** Dir structure

To include a file into a parent file:
	If file to be included is in the same directory, use input{filename.tex}
	If it is in a subfolder, use import*{subdir/}{filename.tex}


** Bullets vs numbers

Use numbers if order is important, or need to refer to particular item
Otherwise use bullets
